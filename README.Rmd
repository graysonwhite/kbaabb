## Overview

The `kbaabb` package provides tools for generating an artificial population
based on a kNN-based approximation to the approximate Bayesian bootstrap
(KBAABB). This methodology is described in [Wieczorek et al. (2024+)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15607).

## Installation

You can install the development version of kbaabb from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("graysonwhite/kbaabb")
```
