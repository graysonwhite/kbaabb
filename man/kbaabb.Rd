\usage{
kbaabb(
  survey_data,
  population_data,
  formula,
  k = 10,
  strata = NULL,
  center_scale = TRUE,
  seed = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{survey_data}{A dataframe containing the survey data to be used for the 
imputation (i.e. "the sample"). This dataframe must contain all variables 
listed in `formula` and `strata`.}

\item{population_data}{A dataframe containing the population data for
imputation to occur on (i.e. "the population"). This dataframe must contain 
all auxiliary variables listed in `formula` and `strata`.}

\item{formula}{The formula specified for imputation, taking the form 
`y ~ x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n` where {x_1, x_2, ..., x_n} is the set of 
auxiliary variables used for imputation and y is the response.}

\item{k}{Integer. The number of neighbors used in the `k` nearest neighbors
imputation}

\item{strata}{Character. The name of a variable to be used for 
stratification. If `NULL` (default), imputation is performed without
stratification. Otherwise, stratification occurs based on the variable
specified in `strata`.}

\item{center_scale}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default), auxiliary variables are
centered and scaled (mean = 0, variance = 1) based on the population data. 
Otherwise, the original sample and population dataframes supplied by the user
are used in an unmodified form.}

\item{seed}{A seed to be set for reproducibility.}

\item{...}{Currently ignored. For extendability.}
}
\value{
A `kbaabb` object including the population data
(`obj$imputed_population_data`), original sample data (`obj$survey_data`),
k (`obj$k`), stratifying indicator and variable
(`obj$stratified`, `obj$strata`), if centering and scaling occurred
(`obj$center_scale`), and the formula used for population imputation 
(`obj$formula`).
}
\description{
`kbaabb()` generates an imputed population dataset based on
methodology introduced in Wieczorek et al. (2023+).
